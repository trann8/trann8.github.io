Hi, I’m Tran (Meg) a lifelong learner with over 10 years of experience in business development and account management. I’ve helped drive revenue growth and build lasting partnerships across leading hospitality brands like IHG, Sofitel, Radisson and high-growth tech startups like Traveloka and Grab. Now, I’m pursuing an MSBA to deepen my data analytics skills and apply data-driven insights to solve complex business challenges.

This blog is where I document my journey, from SQL queries to Tableau dashboards, from business strategy to data storytelling. It’s a space for sharing what I learn, building reusable workflows, and connecting with others who love turning data into impact.

Outside of work, I’m mum to two rescued cats, Jennie and Kimmy 🐾. They were strays living on abandoned land behind my house, barely a year old when I first met them (Jennie is a bit older than Kimmy). I started feeding them, and we bonded quickly. When my neighbor planned to send Kimmy to a shelter, I stepped in to adopt her and soon reunited her with Jennie. Now they’re part of my home, my heart, and sometimes even my data metaphors.
